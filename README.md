# Jets Project

## Description
This project is a fleet of jet objects. jets can have Pilots.

## Topic Covered

* Object-oriented design
* Inheritance
* Arrays
* UML
* JUnit
* Test-Driven Development

## How to Use

When you start this application 
You get a menu of options

* (1) List Fleet
* (2) View Fastest Jet
* (3) View Jet with longest Range
* (4) Add a Jet to Fleet
* (5) List all Pilots
* (6) List Available Pilots
* (7) Hire a Pilot
* (8) Quit

You can use the menu to add new jets and hire new pilots.
The application allows you to enter information about each
and if you enter in Invalid input. I used try catch blocks 
to archive this. Pilots are assigned randomly from available 
pilots. If you don't have any available pilots when adding
a new jet it will prompt you to hire more pilots.
